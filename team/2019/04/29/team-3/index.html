                        Hyperion, a decentralized map paltform, aims to achieve the “One Map” vision - to provide an unified view of global map data and service, and to make it universally accessible just like a public utility for 10B people. Built on the Spatial Consensus Protocol which encloses not just spatial information but also value transfer, Hyperion fundamentally redefines the way we create and consume map services, conforming to our first principles to make maps aggressively open and decentralized.

                            <hr class="star-primary">
                            <img src="img/media/2018-report.jpeg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="image-alt">
                            <p><h4 id="why-do-we-need-an-annual-report">Why do we need an annual report?</h4>
<p>This is the very first annual report of Hyperion project since established, to look back 2018 and see what we have achieved so far. In just a year we figured out the opportunities for decentralized map from the challenges faced by modern map companies like privacy leakage and high data usage cost. Also we managed to develop two decentralized map products for every user to engage with. For Hyperion, 2018 is “the year of Origin for decentralized map”.</p>

<h4 id="great-knowledge-comes-from-the-humblest-of-origins">“Great knowledge comes from the humblest of origins.”</h4>

<h4 id="imagine-wild">Imagine Wild</h4>

<p>Hyperion was born out of stealth as a rebellion to challenge the traditional map industry. We had the great confidence to get early supporters to help us experiment and realize our vision to solve the current problems faced by location data users. However, investors barely had confidence in blockchain industry due to the market downturn in 2018. But in the meantime, thanks to the market panic, Hyperion team was enabled to focus on building up a map service infrastructure where it is trusted, private and secured by the community, while we wait for the winter to be over.</p>

<p>Key words: <strong>Hyperion Culture, bold experimentations</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://medium.com/@hyperionsgoffical/the-world-can-be-a-canvas-and-hyperion-is-the-brush-b7545d23a2da">The world can be a canvas and Hyperion is the brush</a></p>

<p>Luckily, Hyperion never abandoned the vision in decentralized future. For us, spatial consensus means well beyond an engineering methodology, and can support a decentralized map economy of 10 billion people when achieved. In other words, it’s a network of value that can benefit every user through map data usage with privacy protected. In future, as the payment channel built, users can earn economic rewards by joining Hyperion network, for instance, either to provide data service or watch advertisement.</p>

<p>Key words: global map public chain, digital land rights</p>

<h4 id="think-elegant">Think Elegant</h4>

<p>Ideas need refined strategies to put into actions, especially in difficult times, as no investors will take huge risks without expecting high returns. To survive the winter, Hyperion had to re-think about the practical value and feasibility of consensus map future. The key is the good product. Hyperion team quickly reached their consensus in strategy: only by launching high-quality products that can solve real-life problems, can pioneer the market.</p>

<p>Key words: The path to location data autonomy, 10 billion people, map value stack</p>

<h4 id="build-fast">Build Fast</h4>

<p>In mid-2018, since Hyperion published project and Atlas white paper with some early supporters, we have seen significant growth in Hyperion’s vision, technology, and community. We also launched two decentralized map products — MapRush (dMapper) and Map3 (dMap) in Asia, Americas, Oceania and Europe. Details can be found in the two articles below. The two products have attracted more community members to participate our decentralized experiments.</p>

<p>Key words: <strong>MapRush, gaming primitive, social collaboration</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/jvKqNC_T0k6A_PLeNqkfJQ">If you want to go far, go together</a></p>

<p>Key words: security, high speed, service node, Dashboard</p>

<h4 id="what-we-have-accomplished-in-2018">What we have accomplished in 2018</h4>

<p>As the product launched, people start to follow what is ‘decentralized map’, and they register in <a href="https://talk.hyn.space/">Hyperion forum</a> to share feedbacks and answer inquiries. Our early followers have become the driving force to achieve spatial consensus future.</p>

<p>The most important thing in the 1st year is confidence in the project. By Jan 2019, Hyperion has made a huge progress in community size. The number of community members has reached 72,809, compared with the small team of 20 when built, which proves that developing good products and optimizing user experience is the key to spread a great idea.</p>

<p>Key words: <strong>A walk through to decentralized network, low cost, service hosting</strong></p>

<h4 id="what-to-expect-in-2019">What to expect in 2019</h4>

<p>Through struggles and efforts in the past year, consensus map has ceased to be an abstract concept, but still needs further experiment to realize the future. The meaning of spatial consensus has been scattered in every product design, interface style, crowd-participation, and idea exchange between every user.</p>

<p>From February 2019, Hyperion will launch decentralized map dApp Titan, which will enable users to view decentralized map data such as using Google or Baidu map apps. As the same time, we will upgrade Map3 network, launch Main Net in Q3, and update the growing number of service node worldwide. We welcome more creative members to join Hyperion Forum and share your opinions.</p>

                            <hr class="star-primary">

                            <p><p>“Geospatial data is a project that’s too big solve by a single commercial entity with a business model based on commercializing that data. Open collaboration around global map data is the future of maps.” (by <a href="https://www.citylab.com/design/2015/06/who-owns-the-digital-map-of-the-world/396119/">Alex Barth</a> from Mapbox)</p>

<p>With the launch of Map3 network, everyone is enabled to participate and achieve autonomy over location data with the idle resources at home just as how early days bitcoin advocates joined the network. This guide will walk you through Map3 network and help you understand why you should join and how you can contribute to it.</p>

<p><strong>Why decentralized map matters</strong></p>

<p>Users cannot but pay huge map usage costs with company-centric governance over location data. For instance, Google map’s latest pricing scheme charges enterprise users US$2 to US$7 per thousand maps shows. The recent <a href="https://gadgets.ndtv.com/apps/features/google-maps-apis-new-pricing-impact-1907242">increase in API fee</a> for websites or apps that exceeded the limit of 25,000 maps views per day even furthered the expenses for users.</p>

<p>In the meantime, exploiting user privacy has become an unspoken practice of big players. In Jan 2019, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/09/us-cell-carriers-still-selling-your-location-data/?guccounter=1">Techcrunch</a> reveals that US cell carriers still track and sell users real-time location information to other companies in the circumstance of having the same issue just last year. In addition, in Nov 2018, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/27/google-faces-gdpr-complaint-over-deceptive-location-tracking/">Google</a> was complained by European consumer organizations for using manipulative tactics to track users’ locations for ad-targeting purposes. An essay published in <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/it-privacy/">Stanford research</a> studied the consequence of privacy leakage, and claimed that unrestricted access to user account details can harm the data subject in terms of data discrimination and inequality.</p>

<p>By contrast, decentralized map model values every user. It is built based on spatial consensus, and empowers everyone to build, own and govern map data. Only such decentralized map features pervasive and updated data with low cost while it also protects privacy.</p>

Figure2. Datanyze Statistics</p>

<p><a href="https://trends.builtwith.com/mapping/OpenStreetMap">Built-with statistics</a> shows that since January 2018, 20,412 websites worldwide have been using open-source maps instead of Google Maps. The number includes <a href="https://trends.builtwith.com/mapping/OpenStreetMap">1.12% of top 1 million sites</a>. Although the market share still seems narrow, open-source map has clearly been making up ground with a <a href="https://www.datanyze.com/market-share/mapping-and-gis/google-maps-api-vs-mapbox-gl-js-api">growing number of usage</a>. The stumbling block to its prevalence is a lack of well-designed user incentive system, which has been solved by Hyperion ecosystem.</p>

<p><strong>What is Map3 network</strong></p>

<p>Hyperion ecosystem proposes an integrated design of technology, economy and community for everyone. A normal home computer will suffice to join Map3 network, run as a node for service hosting and provide valuable services. When token payment channels built, each service contributor will share the network’s total economic return.</p>

<p>To better understand how Map3 works, let’s provide an example. If 1 million home computer users have joined Map3 network, and the network receives 1 trillion map requests per day, each service node will handle 1 million requests. Let’s presume per thousand data usage charges US$0.05, in return each service provider can earn US$50 every day, while the cost is marginal. It means with very low cost, each user can earn extra income by simply running the node at home. In the meantime, to ensure data quality, Map3 will encourage frequently updated and trusted nodes by prioritizing their reward payment.</p>

<p><strong>A Walk Through to Map3 network</strong></p>

<p>What is a service node? Map3 network comprises core and edge layers. Nodes are distributed in the two layers. A core node requires 60G hard disk space to record map data; but an edge node only needs to receive data requests, transfer data from the core node, and send it peer to peer to end users, which is known as a service node. Home computer users are recommended to join as a service node.</p>

<p>Hyperion also published a test map and a Dashboard to visualize individual node performance. When the node is providing services normally, the map will show location data. In the meantime, Dashboard will present statistics of served requests, CPU and memory usage. We highly welcome our creative community to participate in enriching Dashboard presentation by joining us at Hyperion Forum as the network grows.</p>

Dashboard for service node</p>

<p>For entry-level users, we have minimized the steps to join Map3 at ease. The first step is to create an account at AWS. After creating the account, the system will automatically deploy an edge node in the network just with one click. You can follow the official AWS for detailed instructions. To facilitate reading, we also attach a simple walk through of the overall process below.</p>

  </li>
  <li>You have now created an edge node. Wait <strong>2–3 minutes</strong> for the system to confirm.
  <img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Y-6rlhXoublU1x38hNSKeQ.png" alt="" class="img-responsive" /></li>
  <li>Check your edge node operation status by visiting the link below:<a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home#Instances:sort=desc:instanceState">https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home#Instances:sort=desc:instanceState</a> Choose your preferred region if you need when opening the link above.
Remember to obtain your public IP (you need <strong>Ipv4</strong> to view individual node Dashboard)
<img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*_jh-kTTxVRbho7cxbDhyRA.png" alt="" class="img-responsive" /></li>
  <li>The node is being prepared</li>
  <li>The node is in operation
  <img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*LN1hZvluj51ZMRJuhA2quA.png" alt="" class="img-responsive" /></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Tip. 1</strong> Enter you public IP(IPV4 ONLY) on your browser, you can see your own map node dashboard. The username and password for dashboard is “<strong>admin</strong>”</p>

<p><strong>Tip. 2</strong> Once you deploy the node, you <strong>don’t</strong> have to always keep your computers live or AWS account logged in.</p>

<p><strong>Tip. 3</strong> You can raise as many Map 3 notes as you wish as long as you follow the instruction above. But please note that Amazon might <strong>charge</strong> you for this as <strong>t2.micro</strong> has limited free usage and bandwidth.</p>

<p><strong>Step3: How to delete a node</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Click “<strong>Create Stack</strong>”dropdown menu, and choose delete Stack
<img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*GnKXIreHYOOrP2rEC5U2gw.png" alt="" class="img-responsive" /></li>
  <li>Click “<strong>Yes, Delete</strong>” to delete Stack
<img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*k-4wfW2QNci3DUVVRPoOTQ.png" alt="" class="img-responsive" /></li>
  <li>Confirm your status

<p>Among all kinds of smartphone activities, getting location information is the most used service or universal task for the smartphone users. 8 out of 10 smartphone owners use their phone to get directions, recommendations or other information related to their location.</p>

<p>Unlike other mobile activities, location-based services appeal to all age groups &amp; genders making it most used activity in smartphones. Enterprise see great opportunity to capitalize on this to market their offerings to potential consumers.</p>

<p>How does it work: Let’s consider you are leaving your home for shopping. Once you entering the shopping mall, brand in the shopping mall may recognize your location and send you a promotion offer message. You are more likely to visit this store and check on the offering.</p>

<p>It is obvious from the above case, how effective location service advertisements can be to get the attention of customers at the specific moment and have higher likely-hood of gaining new customers.</p>

<p><strong>“Due to low ROI of marketing activities from traditional ways (content not reaching to potential customers), the enterprise finds location service advertisements as an answer.”</strong></p>

<div class="language-text highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>As per the report from “Markets and Markets”, the location-based services market is expected to grow to $77.8 Billion by 2021.

– 66% of enterprises rank Location Intelligence as either critical or very important to ongoing revenue growth strategies.

– Enterprises comprised of between 1K and 5K employees say Location Intelligence is critically important to their business success.

– Location-based marketing and location services saw greater adoption in 2016 -2017 and 2018 predictions forecast this to be the year businesses take a “location-first” approach in their marketing, mobile and growth strategy.

<h4 id="we-talked-about-the-growth-in-location-service-promotion-but-how-this-location-information-is-collected">We talked about the growth in location service promotion, but how this location information is collected?</h4>

<p>Did you know smartphones collect GPS location information? Check out the below video for proof.
<a href="https://youtu.be/TuxJIOC8_7o" target="_blank"><img src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/TuxJIOC8_7o/0.jpg" alt="Click to play" /></a></p>

<p>Since the beginning of 2017, phones have been collecting the addresses of nearby cellular towers — even when location services are disabled and sending that data back to companies, for e.g. Google.</p>

<p>The result is that Google has access to data about individuals’ locations history and their movements. This information is then sold out to third parties or enterprises who use this for location service promotions.</p>

<p>This goes far beyond a reasonable consumer expectation of privacy and irony is our information is sold without our knowledge and benefits are not shared back with the individual whose data was sold to third-parties.</p>

<p><strong>Hyperion returns power to its consumers:</strong>
Now with Hyperion, you can have an upper-hand and decide if you want to share and monetize your location data or would like to keep it hidden which is not possible to do with location services like google map. (Read more <a href="https://qz.com/1131515/google-collects-android-users-locations-even-when-location-services-are-disabled/">here</a> )</p>

<p><strong>Hyperion will help to bring much needed “transparency, privacy and ownership” for its app users, but what attracts users to use Hyperion:</strong></p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>1. High Accuracy: The Hyperion approach of making governance and production of maps, community-driven makes the maps in Hyperion frequently updated and more accurate representation of location information.

2. Early adopters: Reward for contributing to building maps or govern will attract a high number of early adopters.

3. Awareness &amp; ownership: After Google/ Facebook lawsuit, more and more people are becoming aware of how companies are stealing their privacy. This increased concern raise the opportunity for safer options, apps which allow to not share or hide their location information. In Hyperion, users will be able to give their consent or disable location sharing and use of smart contracts (blockchain) will ensure users consent is respected. This will give confidence to users that their data is not with centralized control and can trust Hyperion for safe keeping.

4. Share benefits: Hyperion is the only place where users location information can be monetized and profits are shared back with the individual.

                            <hr class="star-primary">
                            <img src="img/media/dmap.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="image-alt">
                            <p><p>SINGAPORE, Jan. 8, 2019 /PRNewswire/ — Post release of MapRush on 27th December, 2018, Hyperion has kept its momentum and on 6th January 2019, launched the Map3 DevNet with nodes covering Europe, Asia, America and Australia. Map3 is a secure, and high speed decentralized map network aiming to provide high quality services to business institutions and end consumers. Participants can host a Map3 node similar to the hosting of nodes for Bitcoin and Ethereum, but with a much lower barrier of entry. A standard home computer will suffice to join and run services for the Map3 network.</p>

<p>At the same time, Hyperion is preparing for the launch of the official Dashboard to provide our users and token holders a detailed view into the status of the project.</p>

<p>About maps:</p>

<p>Maps are huge business. Today approximately 1/3 of top domains are integrated with maps,
serving 1 trillion location requests daily. <a href="https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/pricing/sheet/">Google maps latest pricing</a> scheme charges enterprise users US$2 to US$7 per thousand maps shows. Maps have developed from a flat picture of locations to include geographic, meteorological data, even transportation planning, commercial and other useful information needed to reach spatial consensus, which enables us to connect with the world much more easily.</p>

<p>Digital maps have proved their efficiency to enable consumer applications e.g. location based social networks, maps, etc. However, prior to Hyperion, location data could only be distributed through centralized organizations with the cost of user privacy. As reported by Techcrunch, location privacy is a dire issue these days. The Cambridge Analytica scandal is another showcase of how large players have been compromising user data. In addition to the privacy issue, digital map lacks pervasiveness as it is prohibitively expensive to update frequently.</p>

<p>Map3 – DMap Service Network</p>

<p>Map3 embodies the idea of Web 3.0, a decentralized map that conforms to the intrinsic values of Web3. Map3 changes the landscape and re-distributes wealth and opportunity to the open-participating community by enabling secure and privacy preserved peer to peer servicing.</p>

<p>MapRush (Dmapper) encourages users to upload location data and provide data correction within the network. This solution will eventually revolutionize the mapping era, and respond to the issue of location data derivatives.</p>

<p>Map3 will introduce more features in the future such as custom p2p protocol, byzantine tolerance and token payment channels according to user feedback. With the improvement of network nodes, Map3 will be able to provide more personal services to users.</p>

<p>Titan, the decentralised map for everyone</p>

<p>Hyperion will officially launch a beta version of Titan in February 2019. Users can download Titan and see location information based on the Map3 network. Titan supports custom map styles – users can be a map designer to redefine the look of spaces. In the future, Titan will serve more location-based functions such as advertisements, searches and positioning.</p>

<p>Hyperion – the future of Spatial Consensus Maps</p>

<p>With technological baseline set in place, Hyperion team will then work on the important mechanism design to correctly incentivize players in the current location ecosystem to join our network.</p>

<p>Hyperion strives for organically integrated innovations in three critical dimensions, coined as the Hyperion Trinity of map technology, economy and society structures, to eventually achieve a sustainable and self-governed map economy of the world. With this, Hyperion will finally achieve the real ‘free map service’.</p>

<p>Hyperion, the spatial consensus map from the future, has been revealed.</p>

                            <h3>Hyperion Co-Founder Dr Isaac Zhang：Blockchain empowers the world's largest digital location right</h3>
                            <hr class="star-primary">
                            <img src="img/media/hyperion-help.jpeg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="image-alt">
                            <p><p>SINGAPORE, Oct. 22, 2018 /PRNewswire/ – Virtual real estate has become a major application in the blockchain world, and Hyperion is the standout project in this arena. The world’s largest map public chain based on spatial consensus protocol, Hyperion is designed with a community incentive model and its ultimate goal is autonomy in digital location rights.</p>

<p><strong>An indispensable base layer public chain, an infrastructure that supports 10 billion users</strong></p>

<p>Blockchain can be applied in numerous fields, such as finance, gaming, and product traceability. To Hyperion co-founder Dr Isaac Zhang, the future of blockchain is as infrastructure. Blockchain can only be further developed through the application and popularization of its technology. Maps are a natural starting point.</p>

<p>Hyperion intends to build a decentralized map economy that supports 10 billion people. Centered around Hyperion’s digital land rights, the economic system is based on the Hyperion Trinity of crowdsourcing technology, crowd-sharing rewards, and community governance.</p>

<p>Hyperion’s core model has three prongs: land rights mining, land rights dividends, and land rights autonomy. Land mining refers to users contributing map data to obtain HYN currency. Map data is generated by the community based on a spatial consensus protocol, while mapping technology is maintained by a tech community scattered globally.</p>

<p><strong>Dividends for every contributor</strong></p>

<p>With Hyperion’s crowdsourcing technology, everyone has the tools and rights to improve and maintain the map. The Philippines, for example, is made up of thousands of islands, and impossible to map in updated detail in a centralized model without incurring astronomical costs. With a decentralized global map public chain like Hyperion, however, anyone can tag, upload, and authenticate this location without being restricted by a centralized map platform.</p>

<p>Economy sharing is also a feature of Hyperion that differs from traditional mapping. Centralized mapping platform giants net huge profits by using private user data – for free. Users provide more than 500,000 pieces of information and more than 400,000 photos daily to Baidu maps. With free contributions come two disadvantages. First, there is a lack of motivation to upload map information. Secondly, without reasonable reward, a rational person has no incentive to access dangerous or remote areas.</p>

<p>With Hyperion, data democracy and benefits-sharing are realized. The community is incentivized through the token, and the value of the token depends on the consensus and contribution of the community. Each user is not only a data contributor but also a beneficiary of sustainable incentives. The more you use, the more you get. Economic benefits are shared by digital land rights holders and automatically distributed by smart contracts. A user also gets a share when his data is used for commercial purposes. In other words, this is a marketplace for the acquisition, sale/resale and rental of digital land.</p>

<p>What’s more, the blockchain map is governed by the community, and community users are the ones who make decisions that influence map services and economic models. This, simply, is land rights autonomy.</p>

<p><strong>Innovative Consensus Agreement to Improve Transaction Performance</strong></p>

<p>The data generation speed and load of current times are unprecedented. The scale of spatial data and high-speed requirements are a challenge to Hyperion. Dr Zhang’s solution to this is unique. Compared to other public chain projects on the market, Hyperion’s core difference lies in the innovative consensus mechanism. Hyperion’s main chain consists of two layers: the base chain uses bft + dPOS, a design in line with Hyperion’s hierarchical community governance principles. The second layer is the space chain, which uses pBFT + SCP (spatial consensus protocol) – pBFT makes the block notary signature, and SCP does the determination of the spatial data state. There are two designs in the space chain. Spatial data is elastically fragmented twice in the elastic space consensus. The first fragmentation is aligned with the locality of the network level and the application level, and can be flexibly adjusted according to the quantity. The second fragment is in the shard, and the local processing is segmented for multi-core parallel computing. Both shards can be merged globally by the pull-reduce method.</p>

<p>Hyperion is designed to have high performance and low latency. High performance is achieved through elastic space sharding. There are two levels of low latency. First, network-level delay is a general problem of distributed systems. The key is to build the locality of the application layer and the network layer. This point is optimized for the first slice of the elastic space slice. The locality of the network layer can be simply understood as finding a nearby shard to handle the requirements. The second is the final delay time. The BFT series of solutions is fast and can be finalized in one second. This is particularly relevant to map chains because of the cross chains across many applications. Hyperion maintains the characteristics of multi-centeredness with the use of these two technologies.</p>

<p>To some, blockchain is a bubble waiting to burst. Dr Zhang, however, firmly believes that blockchain will revolutionize businesses and human knowledge. After all, everyone should have the right to define the Earth’s space equally.</p>

                            <h3>Atlas by Hyperion： Global Blockchain-based Mapping Ecosystem Democratizes Map Making and Its Monetization</h3>
                            <hr class="star-primary">
                            <img src="img/media/hyperion-team.jpeg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="image-alt">
                            <p><p>SINGAPORE, Sept. 14, 2018 /PRNewswire/ – Anyone can participate in the making of and upkeep of a map – and make money from it. That’s the powerfully ambitious plan that Hyperion has for its new decentralized global map economy. <strong>Atlas</strong>, the <strong>Spatial Consensus Blockchain</strong>, is designed with the <strong>Hyperion Trinity</strong> in mind: (1) maps can be crowd-built because quality global map data can be collected from any interested individual and maps can be maintained by the public collective, (2) a secure, crowd-sharing reward infrastructure exists to incentivize contributors for their efforts, and (3) community-based crowd-governing structures oversee the smooth running and maintenance of the ecosystem. To put it simply, Atlas empowers people to build map technology, share economic returns and self-govern map communities.</p>

<p>“By liberating maps from the traditional highly controlled model, we intend to fundamentally transform the global economy. We believe that map data should be open and accessible to all, and that by doing so we will unlock massive untapped value in the products and services we or other parties can build on this data.” – Mr Isaac Zhang, Hyperion founder</p>

<p>The three dimensions of the Hyperion Trinity are supported by the innovative <strong>Elastic Spatial Sharding</strong> scheme. With this transformative solution, Atlas ingeniously resolves three intrinsic challenges of consensus mapping.</p>

<p>First, information of space is highly skewed and unpredictable – we have no control of how and where things happen on maps. A highly dynamic and elastic load-balancing of network infrastructure is thus needed. Secondly, the way spatial information is handled must be able to scale easily with the increase and decrease of participants and requirements, and the representation of spatial data needs to support the requirements of efficient and robust multi-dimensional indexing and operation. Thirdly, to effectively process spatial data on a global scale, an effective sharding scheme has to enable massive parallelization.</p>

<p>Atlas’s Elastic Spatial Sharding solution is elegantly simple and was designed based on the deceptively and equally simple Hilbert Curve, a fractal space-filling curve. A fractal curve has the same pattern across varying magnitudes. The curve is space-filling if it is able to visit every point in a planar area. It defines a continuous mapping from a lower-dimensional space (a line) into a higher-dimensional space (a plane). With liberal use of the Hilbert Curve, Atlas has formulated a comprehensive solution. The Hilbert curve is employed deterministically to address every location on the planet on multi-levels to preserve the neighborhood of locations.</p>

<p>At the same time, Atlas will resolve privacy and cost issues we face with current centralized map data and map service providers. Corporations pay a large fee for use of map services. For individuals, the price is exacted in the loss of privacy. Specifically, with respect to private map data, user location traces and user profile information, Atlas employs block production protocols based on proven works such as OmniLedger and RapidChain.</p>

<p>To conclude, Atlas is the first blockchain built purposefully for hosting a diversified spatial data structure. All service nodes of the Atlas network are spatially indexed, supporting fast queries and other complex geospatial operations such as localization to compute location with triangulation, performing nearby searches and finding optimal routes. That means real-time map data and service information, all the time, in an open and decentralized ecosystem that is accessible to everyone.</p>
